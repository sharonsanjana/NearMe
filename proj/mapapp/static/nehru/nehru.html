      <h1>Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (Chennai)</h1>
      <p class="bio">The stadium was built on the area where the old Madras Zoo was located before it was shifted to its present location in at Vandalur.[4] It was known as the Corporation stadium until the 1980s and used to witness houseful audience for even the city league matches. When C. R. Viswanathan, then the Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Football Association, was keen on bringing the Nehru Cup international football tournament to Chennai, a stadium of international standard was required. He approached the then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa with a plan to convert the old Corporation stadium into a brand-new ultra-modern facility.[5] The Chief Minister soon gave her approval[6] and the new stadium was built in 1993, within a span of 234 days, at a cost of ₹440 million (US$5.5 million).[2] In January 1993, the competition was conducted successfully in the new facility that was acknowledged to be arguably the best in the country also doubling up as a track and field venue.[6] In 2012, the Government of Tamil Nadu renovated the indoor stadium at a cost of ₹120 million (US$1.5 million) with a new skating rink.[7] In 2013, Government of Tamil Nadu upgraded the synthetic athletics track, football turf, floodlights and upgrading added a warm-up track north of the stadium at a cost of ₹331 million (US$4.1 million)</p>
